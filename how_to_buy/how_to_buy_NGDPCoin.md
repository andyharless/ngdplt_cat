1. Set up a Chia wallet.
   * Desktop: Download [official client](https://www.chia.net/downloads/).
   * Android: Install [Pawket app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pawket.wallet) (or any of various others you can find described [on the Chia web site](https://www.chia.net/buy-xch/)).
   * iOS: Install [TestFlight](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664) and then the [Pawket app beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/GWcIleEy) (or use any of the various others described [on the Chia web site](https://www.chia.net/buy-xch/)â€”but Pawket is probably the best right now despite being in beta).
2. Get XCH......One way to do this:
   * Set up a [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/) account.
   * Fund the account (e.g., by transferring money from your bank account or by sending other crypto to your Crypto.com address).
   * Buy XCH on Crypto.com.
   * Send the XCH to your Chia wallet set up in step 1.
   * Other possibilities are noted [on the Chia web site](https://www.chia.net/buy-xch/).
3. Add the StellaCoin (STDG) token to the list of CATs (Chia Asset Tokens) your wallet recognizes.
   * The exact method for doing this will depend on what kind of wallet you are using. For example, in the official desktop app, you would click on "Manage Token List" in the Tokens tab, click the + sign, and then enter the name you will use (e.g. "StellaCoin (STDG)") and the Asset ID.
   * The Asset ID for StellaCoin is `64d1e7e794464053858763f2082eb595ed4416976bed72ca679a553839ff189c`
   * You can look up Asset IDs for tokens like StellaCoin in [TAIL Database](https://www.taildatabase.com/explore). (TAIL stands for "Token Asset Issuance Limiter," which is the program that defines how a CAT works.)
4. Use XCH to purchase StellaCoin (STDG)......One way to do this:
   * Go to [TibetSwap](https://v2.tibetswap.io/).
   * Select StellaCoin from the "Select a token" dropdown list.
   * Enter either the amount of STDG you are buying or the amount of XCH you are using to buy it.
   * Click the "Swap" button.
   * TibetSwap will show you the terms of an Offer you need to make.
   * Using your wallet, generate the specified Offer. (The method will differ depending on what kind of wallet you use. In the official desktop client, you would click on the "CREATE AN OFFER" button in the "Offers" tab, fill in the amount of XCH you are paying and the amount and type of token you are buying and optionally a fee, and click the "CREATE OFFER" button.)
   * Copy and paste the offer text (a long, not-human-readable string: the contents of the Offer File if you saved your offer as a file by clicking "Save Offer File" in the desktop client) into the appropriate space on the TibetSwap window, and click "Submit Manually".
   * Alternatively you can link your wallet to TibetSwap using WalletConnect and then interact directly without copy-pasting. This makes the purchase process simpler, but it's not trivial to set up.
   * If you are doing a large transaction, it might be better to try finding an offer on [Dexie](http://dexie.space/offers/STDG/XCH) that you can accept or [making an offer](http://dexie.space/offers/XCH/STDG).
